## What is Nodejs?

--> Nodejs is javascript runtime environment which runs javascript on the server side.

----

## REPL

--> REPL is used to do experiment with the js code and debug it.

REPL stands for 

1) Read
2) Eval
3) Print
4) Loop

>Just write `node` in terminal to enter into REPL

==> You can do these things in REPL : 

1) play with js expressions (+ - * /)
2) make variables
3) Multiline code / loops
4) use `_` to get the previous value 

Example : 

```js
var a = 5;
a
_ + 5
// it will show 10
```

--> Difference between argument and parameter

>when you define the function then it called argument and when you call the function with some given value then it called parameter

5) Use the editor mode

If you want to go into editor mode then just type `.editor` and then you can create a whole function in multiline and you can do other things also
