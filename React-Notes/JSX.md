# JSX
-----

--> jsx is known as javascript extension or javascript XML 

--> when we import the react module we are importing the JSX 
```js
import react from 'react';
```

--> when we add the render function on bebal website then we can see that it's using react module in JSX

--> so JSX is nothing but the code which will be converted by babel to the format which is understandable by our browser
